## 🎯 Introduction
Our project is Smart Reconciliation. We have built an anomaly detector to flag anomalous entries for the reconciliation breaks. The insights are generated using LLM.

## 🎥 Demo

## 💡 Inspiration
The reconcilers manually process the reconciliation breaks and detecting anomalies by analysing manually is a time consuming and tedious process. In our application systems, we have reconciliation processes and hence we wanted to implement the problem statement.

## ⚙️ What It Does
1. Detect anomalies, define anomaly score
2. Streamlit UI for easy use

## 🛠️ How We Built It
1. Numpy, Pandas
2. OpenAI
3. Seaborn
4. Transformers

## 🏃 How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ewfx/sradg-code-cadets.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt (for Python)
   ```
3. Add the current.xlsx and historical.xlsx to data folder
4. Run the project  
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
